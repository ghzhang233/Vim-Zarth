# ZarthVim
## Introduction
This is a effective yet fast configuration for Vim in terminal. Only five useful plugins are installed. No syntax check or autocompletion plugins are included for speed consideration. Specifically, the keymap is as follows,
```
kj -> <ESC>
,(comma) -> <Leader>

<Leader>cc -> Comment this line
<Leader>cc -> Unomment this line

C-e -> Open NerdTree

C-n -> Next buffer
C-p -> Last buffer

F1 -> Chinese help document
```


## Installation
Feel free to use it with following command!
```shell
./run.sh
```
